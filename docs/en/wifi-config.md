## 2. Use a mobile phone (or Pad) for configuration

Scan the QR code displayed on the device's LCD screen with your mobile phone (or Pad).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Please use the iOS / Android **system-level** QR code scanning function. Common options are:

- The QR code scanning function in the native camera application

The main model, WTHM, can monitor environmental temperature and relative humidity in real time. There are also series products such as WCO2 that can monitor the concentration of carbon dioxide in the environment, and WVOC that can monitor the concentration of TVOC in the environment. The WTHM series of IoT devices use a 2.4G Wi-Fi network and support standard USB Type-C 5V power supply. The WTHM series of IoT devices support a variety of industrial standard communication protocols, including Modbus TCP, SNMP, BACnet, and MQTT. The WTHM series of IoT devices are compatible with mainstream IoT platforms in the market, including AWS/Azure/Tuya IoT cloud. It supports Home Assistant, IFTTT, and Email.

Enter Configuration Mode Press and hold the \u2191 and \u2193 buttons on the WTHM device panel for 3 seconds to enter the Wi-Fi configuration process. You can release the buttons after the LCD screen displays \"Entering setup...\". When the LCD screen displays the Wi-Fi AP QR code , it means the device has successfully entered Wi-Fi configuration mode. 2. Use a mobile phone (or Pad) for configuration Scan the QR code displayed on the device's LCD screen with your mobile phone (or Pad). \u26a0\ufe0f Note : Please use the iOS / Android system-level QR code scanning function. Common options are: The QR code scanning function in the native camera application The QR code scanning function in Settings -> WLAN The QR code scanning function in the system browser During the process of scanning the QR code, if the mobile phone system prompts you to connect to the \"\ud83d\udedc WTHM-xxx\" Wi-Fi network, please select Yes . After the mobile phone successfully connects to the WTHM device's Wi-Fi network, most mobile phone systems will automatically jump to the configuration page. On the configuration page, enter the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password that the device is to connect to, and then click Submit to submit the configuration. \u26a0\ufe0f Note : If your mobile phone fails to jump to the configuration page normally, please refer to this detailed guide . 3. Check the Wi-Fi connection status on the device After completing the configuration operation, the WTHM device will automatically exit the configuration mode and try to connect to the configured Wi-Fi network. You can check the Wi-Fi network connection status on the device's LCD screen. Wi-Fi Authentication Mode Support Specification Under its standard network configuration, the product natively supports Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) that utilize the following personal-grade security protocols: WPA-Personal / WPA2-Personal (PSK-based, Pre-Shared Key) WPA3-Personal (SAE-based, Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) WPA2/WPA3 Mixed/Transition Mode Connection to wireless networks employing other authentication methods, such as: Enterprise-grade authentication, e.g., WPA/WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise (802.1X/EAP-based) Open (Unsecured) networks Legacy WEP protocol requires an advanced configuration procedure.
